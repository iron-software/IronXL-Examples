## 1. Install the Library 

Either [download the Library via DLL](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/packages/IronXL.Package.For.read.excel.example.zip) or [access it through NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronXL.Excel). The IronXL library offers comprehensive capabilities for inputting and manipulating Excel file data, perfect for any project development.

```shell
Install-Package IronXL.Excel
```

## 2. Open the WorkSheet 

Begin by learning how to [read Excel file data](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/tutorials/how-to-read-excel-file-csharp/) in C# by loading an Excel file and selecting the desired worksheet in your project.

```cs
// Load the Excel file
WorkBook wb = WorkBook.Load("Path");
```

In the snippet above, we create a `WorkBook` object, `wb`, which loads the specified Excel file. Following that, we can open any `WorkSheet` in the Excel file as demonstrated below:

```cs
// Open a WorkSheet
WorkSheet ws = wb.GetWorkSheet("SheetName");
```

`wb` represents the `WorkBook` instantiated previously. `ws` is the `WorkSheet` object which allows access to various data extraction methods.

Letâ€™s explore different examples to gain insights into extracting data from Excel spreadsheets using IronXL.

## 3. Read Cell Value of Excel File

To retrieve specific cell values from an Excel file, we use the `WorkSheet[]` operator in IronXL.

```cs
string val = WorkSheet["Cell Address"].ToString();
```

This expression fetches data at a particular cell address. Alternatively, we can get cell data using row and column indexing as follows:

```cs
string val = WorkSheet.Rows[RowIndex].Columns[ColumnIndex].ToString();
```

<b>Note: Both row and column indexing start from `0`.</b>

Consider the following example that demonstrates the extraction of data from an Excel file using both methods mentioned.

```cs
/**
Read Cell Values
anchor-read-cell-value-of-excel-file
**/
using IronXL;
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    WorkBook wb = WorkBook.Load("sample.xlsx");
    WorkSheet ws = wb.GetWorkSheet("Sheet1");
    // Retrieve value by cell address
    string address_val = ws["B3"].ToString();
    // Retrieve value by row and column indexing
    string index_val = ws.Rows[5].Columns[1].ToString();
    Console.WriteLine("Value obtained by Cell Address:\n Value of cell B3: {0}", address_val);
    Console.WriteLine("Value obtained by Row and Column index:\n Value of Row 5, Column 1: {0}", index_val);
    Console.ReadKey();
}
```

The output displayed will be:
