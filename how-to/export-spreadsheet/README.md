# How to Save or Export Spreadsheets

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/how-to/export-spreadsheet/>***


The `DataSet` class is a pivotal aspect of the ADO.NET architecture within Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. It facilitates manipulation and access to data originating from various sources such as databases, XML files, and other data types, making it essential for database-related applications.

With IronXL, users can transform Excel workbooks into numerous file formats or into inline code objects for increased flexibility. Supported file formats include `XLS`, `XLSX`, `XLSM`, `CSV`, `TSV`, `JSON`, `XML`, and `HTML`. The inline code objects enable the exporting of an Excel file as a `HTML` string, binary data, byte array, dataset, or stream.

## Export Spreadsheet Tutorial

Once you have completed modifying or reviewing your workbook, you can employ the `SaveAs` method to save your Excel spreadsheet into one of the supported file formats, including `XLS`, `XLSX`, `XLSM`, `CSV`, `TSV`, `JSON`, `XML`, and `HTML`.

It is important to specify the file extension during export. Newly created Excel files will generally be saved in the 'bin > Debug > net6.0' directory within your project.

```cs
using IronXL;
using IronXL.Excel;
namespace ironxl.ExportSpreadsheet
{
    public class ExportExample
    {
        public void Execute()
        {
            // Instantiate a new Excel workbook
            WorkBook workbook = WorkBook.Create();

            // Generate a new WorkSheet
            WorkSheet sheet = workbook.CreateWorkSheet("example_sheet");

            // Save the document in different formats like XLS, XLSX, XLSM, CSV, TSV, JSON, XML, HTML
            workbook.SaveAs("example.xls");
        }
    }
}
```

## Exporting CSV, JSON, XML, and HTML Files

While the `SaveAs` method allows for exporting to `CSV`, `JSON`, `XML`, and `HTML` formats, it is advised to use specific methods tailored for each format. Use `SaveAsCsv`, `SaveAsJson`, `SaveAsXml`, and `ExportToHtml` for best results.

```cs
using IronXL;
using IronXL.Excel;
namespace ironxl.ExportSpreadsheet
{
    public class ExportFormats
    {
        public void Execute()
        {
            // Instantiate a new Excel WorkBook
            WorkBook workbook = WorkBook.Create();

            // Initialize multiple WorkSheets
            WorkSheet sheet1 = workbook.CreateWorkSheet("worksheetA");
            WorkSheet sheet2 = workbook.CreateWorkSheet("worksheetB");

            // Populate cells with data
            sheet1["A1"].StringValue = "Data1";
            sheet2["A1"].StringValue = "Data2";

            // Export as different file formats
            workbook.SaveAsCsv("data.csv");
            workbook.SaveAsJson("data.json");
            workbook.SaveAsXml("data.xml");
            workbook.ExportToHtml("data.html");
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that for `CSV`, `TSV`, `JSON`, and `XML` file formats, distinct files will be generated for each sheet following the format **fileName.sheetName.format**. The illustration below shows files created for each format.

## Export to Inline Code Object

Export the Excel workbook to a variety of inline code objects like HTML strings, binary data, byte arrays, streams, and a .NET `DataSet`. These objects can be directly utilized for further applications.

```cs
using System.IO;
using IronXL.Excel;
namespace ironxl.ExportSpreadsheet
{
    public class InlineExport
    {
        public void Execute()
        {
            // Create a new Excel WorkBook
            WorkBook workbook = WorkBook.Create();

            // Add a fresh WorkSheet
            WorkSheet sheet = workbook.CreateWorkSheet("new_sheet");

            // Export to HTML string
            string htmlContent = workbook.ExportToHtmlString();

            // Export as both binary and byte array
            byte[] binaryData = workbook.ToBinary();
            byte[] byteArrayData = workbook.ToByteArray();

            // Export as Stream
            Stream fileStream = workbook.ToStream();

            // Convert to DataSet for easy data manipulation
            System.Data.DataSet dataSet = workbook.ToDataSet();
        }
    }
}
