# IronXL Now Supports macOS for .NET Core

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/how-to/macos/>***


IronXL has expanded its compatibility to include full support for macOS (previously referred to as "OS X") across .NET Standard Libraries, Core applications, and .NET 5 projects.

All macOS versions are seamlessly supported with IronXL.

There is no need to modify any code to accommodate Apple users or developers.

The inclusion of macOS support is crucial as many .NET developers, including our team members, prefer to use _Visual Studio for Mac_ and _JetBrains Rider_ for developing .NET applications on macOS.

## Setting Up macOS with IronXL

You can download IronXL's NuGet Packages for Mac deployments as documented in our [IronXL NuGet installation guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/docs/).
