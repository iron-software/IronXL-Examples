# IronXL Compatibility with macOS for .NET Applications

IronXL has extended its support to include macOS environments, perfectly integrating with .NET Standard, .NET Core, and .NET 5 projects.

IronXL is designed to work seamlessly across all macOS versions, ensuring complete compatibility.

Developers need not modify their code to make it compatible for Apple users.

Embracing macOS is crucial for us as it's preferred by many .NET developers, including those within our team who utilize tools like _Visual Studio for Mac_ and _JetBrains Rider_.
