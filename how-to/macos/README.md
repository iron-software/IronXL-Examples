# IronXL Compatibility with macOS for .NET Applications

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/how-to/macos/>***


IronXL now offers comprehensive support for macOS environments across .NET Standard Libraries, Core applications, and .NET 5 projects.

There is seamless compatibility with all releases of macOS right from the start.

The integration does not demand any modifications in the codebase to accommodate Apple users or developers.

Supporting macOS is significant for us, as many .NET developers, including our team members, prefer to use _Visual Studio for Mac_ and _JetBrains Rider_ to develop .NET applications on macOS.

## Installation and Setup on macOS

IronXL NuGet packages are available for macOS deployments. For more details, refer to our [IronXL NuGet installation guide](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/docs/).
