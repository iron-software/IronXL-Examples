## 1. Create C# Excel Spreadsheets with IronXL

We'll utilize the IronXL library, a robust C# tool for Excel manipulation, enabling efficient file creation and management for development projects. Start by installing this tool and following this tutorial.

[Download for your project](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/packages/IronXL.Package.For.Create.Excel.Csharp.Spreadsheets.zip) or via [NuGet to integrate into Visual Studio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronXL.Excel).

<br>

```shell
Install-Package IronXL.Excel
```

## 2. C# Create Excel Workbook

Post installation of IronXL, initiate the creation of an Excel Workbook using:

```cs
WorkBook wb = WorkBook.Create();
```

This establishes a new Excel Workbook `wb`. We can choose the file type (`.xlsx` or `.xls`) using:

```cs
// Create a Workbook with .xlsx extension
WorkBook wb = WorkBook.Create(ExcelFileFormat.XLSX);
// Or with a .xls extension
WorkBook wb = WorkBook.Create(ExcelFileFormat.XLS);
```

Now `wb` is ready to house multiple WorkSheets.

## 3. C# Create Excel WorkSheet

Employing IronXL's method `Workbook.CreateWorkSheet()`, initiate a WorkSheet:

```cs
WorkSheet ws = wb.CreateWorkSheet("SheetName");
```

Where `wb` represents the Workbook, and `ws` is the freshly minted WorkSheet. Further sheets can be added in a similar manner:

```cs
WorkSheet ws1 = wb.CreateWorkSheet("Sheet1");
WorkSheet ws2 = wb.CreateWorkSheet("Sheet2");
```

## 4. Insert Cell Data

You can now begin populating data into specific cells of the WorkSheet using:

```cs
WorkSheet["CellAddress"].Value = "Value";
```

<hr class="separator">

## 5. Insert Data in Range

For data insertion over a wider cell range, use `Range`:

```cs
WorkSheet["FromCellAddress : ToCellAddress"].Value = "value";
```

This fills all encompassed cells with the specified `value`. For more details, visit [C# Excel Ranges](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/#excel-ranges).
