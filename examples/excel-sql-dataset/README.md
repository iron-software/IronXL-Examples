Transform any file with formats like `XLSX`, `XLS`, `XLSM`, `XLTX`, `CSV`, and `TSV` into a `System.Data.DataTable`. This conversion facilitates full integration with `System.Data.SQL` and allows for the seamless population of a **DataGrid**. The `DataTable` created can include a collection of tables, their relationships, and constraints.
