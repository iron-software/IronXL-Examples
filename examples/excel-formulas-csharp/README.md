Leverage IronXL to assign formulas, compute, and retrieve result values without the need for Office Interop. IronXL now supports over **150+ formulas** and continues to expand with each new version. Set a formula using the `Range.Formula` property. Consider the following examples:

```cs
workSheet["A2"].Formula = "=SQRT(A1)";
workSheet["B8"].Formula = "=C9/C11";
workSheet["G31"].Formula = "=TAN(G30)";
```

A formula is essentially an expression designed to calculate the value of a cell. Functions, which are built-in formulas, are readily accessible in Excel.

What makes IronXL stand out among .NET Excel libraries is its broad support for numerous Excel formulas and the ability to instantly calculate values derived from these formulas.

# Implementing Excel Formulas in C&num;

1. Begin by installing a capable Excel library that supports formula manipulation.
2. Open the Excel document and access the primary `Worksheet`.
3. Designate formulas and assign values to specific cells within the spreadsheet.
4. Employ `EvaluateAll` to process all set formulas.
5. Persist the changes by saving the `Workbook` back to an Excel file.
