In Excel, when spreadsheets extend over multiple pages, it's beneficial for clarity and speed of reading to have column or row titles repeat at the top or side of every page. This feature is known as _Repeating Rows and Columns_ or _Header Rows and Columns_. Using IronXL, this helpful functionality can be implemented in a few simple lines of code.

## `SetRepeatingRows(startRow, endRow)`

Utilize this method to define repeating rows. For instance, the code `workSheet.SetRepeatingRows(3, 4)` ensures that rows 4 and 5 will repeat on each page.

## `SetRepeatingColumns(startColumn, endColumn)`

This method establishes repeating columns. For example, `workSheet.SetRepeatingColumns(0, 2)` results in columns A through C repeating across multiple pages.

Note that these methods apply zero-based indexing, meaning column(0) corresponds to "A" and row(1) to 2. Itâ€™s also worth mentioning that using both methods simultaneously will result in the combined effect of repeating rows and columns.

Content spanning multiple pages vertically on the right of the initial page will only apply the repeating column settings. As depicted in Figure 1:

Content that expands multiple pages horizontally at the bottom of the first page will have the repeating row settings applied.

Finally, pages positioned internally will feature both repeating column and row settings. Figure 2 illustrates these last two scenarios:
