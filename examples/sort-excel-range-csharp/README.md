Organizing data by alphabetical or numerical order simplifies the processing of information in Microsoft Excel. The IronXL library streamlines the sorting process for columns, rows, and ranges in C# and VB.NET.

To sort in either ascending or descending order, utilize the `SortAscending` or `SortDescending` method on the desired range or column. However, the `SortByColumn` method requires two arguments: the column to be sorted and the desired order of sorting.
