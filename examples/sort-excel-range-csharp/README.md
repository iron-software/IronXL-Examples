Organizing data according to alphabetic or numeric order simplifies the process of data analysis in Microsoft Excel. IronXL facilitates the straightforward sorting of Excel columns, rows, and ranges in both C# and VB.NET.

To implement sorting, utilize the `SortAscending` or `SortDescending` method on the chosen range or column. The `SortByColumn` method, however, necessitates two parameters: the column you wish to sort and the desired sorting order. 

This ease of data manipulation allows for smoother workflows when dealing with Excel data programmatically.
