Organizing information in a systematic order, whether alphabetically or by value, simplifies the analysis of data within Microsoft Excel. IronXL simplifies the task of sorting Excel columns, rows, and ranges for developers using C# and VB.NET.

To sort data, you can utilize the methods `SortAscending` or `SortDescending` on the specific range or column to apply the desired sort order. The method `SortByColumn`, however, requires two parameters: the first is the column you want to sort, and the second specifies the sort direction.
