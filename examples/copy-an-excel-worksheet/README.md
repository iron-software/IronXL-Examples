The code snippet illustrates utilizing IronXL for cloning and transferring `WorkSheets` within the same Excel `WorkBook` or to other `WorkBooks`. This allows developers to replicate and reposition sheets across different workbooks or within a single workbook.

To clone a worksheet within the same workbook, apply the `CopySheet` method. This method necessitates providing the name of the new worksheet as a parameter.

For duplicating a sheet to another workbook or vice versa, use the `CopyTo` method. This requires the `WorkBook` as the first parameter, followed by the name for the newly created worksheet.
