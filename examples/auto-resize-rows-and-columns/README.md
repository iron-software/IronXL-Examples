Adjusting the size of rows and columns in spreadsheets can greatly enhance space efficiency and legibility. `IronXL`, a robust C# library, offers capabilities to automatically adjust the sizes of rows and columns. With this functionality implemented in C#, it enables programmatically resizing operations across all existing rows and columns, thereby streamlining what would otherwise be a manual process in spreadsheet management.

## Automatically Adjusting Row Sizes

The `AutoSizeRow` method dynamically alters the height of a specified row to fit its content length. There's an overloaded version of `AutoSizeRow` which accepts a _Boolean_ as a second argument. When set to true, it adjusts the height to accommodate the content of merged cells.

## Automatically Adjusting Column Widths

Employ the `AutoSizeColumn` method to modify the width of a column based on the length of its content. Just like `AutoSizeRow`, it can also adjust for the content within merged cells if required.

It's important to remember that all the positions mentioned for rows and columns use zero-based indexing.
