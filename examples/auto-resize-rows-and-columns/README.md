Adjusting the dimensions of rows and columns in a spreadsheet can enhance clarity and conserve space. The `IronXL` C# library offers effective tools to automate the resizing of rows and columns using C#. This automation is built into the code, enabling the resizing functionalities to be applied to all existing rows and columns, making manual adjustment unnecessary.

## Automatically Adjust Row Sizes

The `AutoSizeRow` method dynamically alters the height of a specified row depending on the length of its content. An alternative version of `AutoSizeRow` accepts a _Boolean_ parameter; if set to true, it adjusts the height to accommodate the dimensions of merged cells within the row.

## Automatically Adjust Column Sizes

The `AutoSizeColumn` method modifies the width of one or more columns based on the content length. Similar to `AutoSizeRow`, this method can be set to consider the width of merged cells during the resizing process.

It's important to remember that all references to positions of rows and columns start from zero, meaning they use zero-based indexing.
