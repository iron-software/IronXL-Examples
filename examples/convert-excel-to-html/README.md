The preceding code snippet elucidates the process of transforming Excel files into HTML using C#. It leverages the `HtmlExportOptions` class, which allows customization of the HTML output. The configurable options include:

- **`OutputRowNumbers`**: Determines if row numbers should be displayed in the resulting file.
- **`OutputColumnHeaders`**: Controls whether the column headers are visible in the output.
- **`OutputHiddenRows`**: Specifies if rows that are hidden in the Excel sheet appear in the HTML file.
- **`OutputHiddenColumns`**: Decides if columns that are hidden in the spreadsheet should be included in the HTML output.
- **`OutputLeadingSpacesAsNonBreaking`**: Ensures that any leading spaces before the first character in a cell are rendered as non-breaking spaces in the generated file.
