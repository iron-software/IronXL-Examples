The above snippet demonstrates how to compute aggregate metrics like sum, average, minimum, and maximum from a specified range of cells in an Excel Spreadsheet. It is important to note that these calculations will automatically exclude any cells that contain non-numeric data.

## Sum

The function `Sum()` calculates the total sum of values within the chosen range of cells.

## Average

Using the function `Avg()`, you can determine the average value from the cells within the specified range.

## Minimum

The `Min()` function identifies the smallest numerical value in the selected range of cells.

## Maximum

Conversely, the `Max()` function finds the highest numerical value within the designated range of cells.

These functions offer versatility as they can be applied not only to a range but also across specific rows or columns for more targeted data analysis.
