The illustrated code snippet demonstrates the straightforward process of obtaining aggregate values from a selected range of cells in an Excel spreadsheet. It's important to note that cells containing non-numeric data will not be included in these calculations.

## Sum

The `Sum()` method calculates and returns the total sum of numerical values within the specified range of cells.

## Average

The `Avg()` method computes the average value from the numbers in the selected range of cells.

## Minimum

Using the `Min()` method, one can determine the smallest number within the chosen range of cells.

## Maximum

Conversely, the `Max()` method identifies the largest number present in the selected range of cells.

These functions are also adaptable to either individual or multiple rows and columns for added versatility in data manipulation.
