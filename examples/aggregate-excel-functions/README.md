In the above example, fetching aggregate values from specific cell ranges in an Excel spreadsheet is demonstrated. It's important to note that cells containing non-numeric data are not considered in these calculations.

## Sum

Utilize the `Sum()` function to compute the total of all numeric values within a designated range.

## Average

To calculate the mean value, the `Avg()` function processes the numeric data from a provided cell range.

## Minimum

To find the smallest number in a set, employ the `Min()` function on your selected range of cells.

## Maximum

Conversely, the `Max()` function determines the largest number from the designated group of cells.

These operations are not limited to entire ranges; they can be specifically applied to individual or multiple rows and columns for enhanced control. Discover how to select rows and columns in detail by visiting [row and column](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/excel/examples/select-excel-range/).
