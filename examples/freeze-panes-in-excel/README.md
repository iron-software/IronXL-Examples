The above code snippet illustrates the method of creating a freeze pane in spreadsheetsâ€”this technique secures rows and columns, ensuring their visibility as the user scrolls. It is particularly beneficial for maintaining the visual presence of headers while quickly comparing data across different sections.

## `CreateFreezePane(column, row)`

The basic version of the `CreateFreezePane` function requires just the column and row indices to set up the freeze pane. For instance, by calling `workSheet.CreateFreezePane(1, 4)`, the freeze pane will encompass **column(A)** and **rows 1 to 4**.

## `CreateFreezePane(column, row, subsequentColumn, subsequentRow)`

An extended variation of this function allows for more complex behavior by also factoring in additional rows and columns for scrolling purposes. Using `workSheet.CreateFreezePane(5, 2, 6, 7)`, the freeze pane will include **columns A to E** and **rows 1 and 2** while enabling a scroll over **one subsequent column** and **five additional rows**. Initially, when the worksheet opens, it will display columns A-E plus G onwards and rows 1-2 plus 8 onwards.

Implementing freeze panes can significantly enhance the readability and usability of large Excel tables by keeping certain rows or columns constantly visible, irrespective of the scrolling done across the rest of the worksheet.
