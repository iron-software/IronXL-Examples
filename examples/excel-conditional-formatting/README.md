The IronXL library offers **Conditional Formatting** for cells and ranges, enabling dynamic styling changes based on predefined logical or programmatic conditions. Styles that can be altered include background color and text style.

To establish a conditional formatting rule, utilize the `CreateConditionalFormattingRule(string formula)` method, which operates based on a Boolean formula. When the result of this formula is true, the respective cell gets highlighted. Itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the formula is a valid Boolean function.

Moreover, the `CreateConditionalFormattingRule` function can also be invoked with three parameters. However, it accepts only `ComparisonOperator.Between` and `ComparisonOperator.NotBetween` as valid options for its first parameter.

Employing conditional formatting, it's possible to visually distinguish cells and ranges through specific color and format setups that hinge on the Boolean true/false evaluation of rules set by the user. This feature greatly enhances data analysis capabilities, allows for quick detection of discrepancies, and aids in recognizing patterns and trends.
